2.1 - Introduction
The cellular concept: Many lower power transmitters (small cells), each providing coverage to only a small portion of the service area.
Each BS is allocated a portion of the total number of channels available to the entire system, and nearby base stations are assigned
different groups of channels so that the interference between base stations (and the mobile users under their control)  is minimized.
By systematically spacing BSs and their channel throughout a market, the available channels are distributed throughout the geographic
region and may be reused as many times as necessary, so long as the interference between co-channel stations is kept below acceptable
levels.

2.5 - Interference and System Capacity
Sources of interference: another mobile in the same cell, a call in progress in a neighboring cell, other BSs operating in the same
frequency band, non-cellular systems leaking energy into the cellular frequency band.
Major types of system-generated cellular interference are co-channel and adjacent channel interference.
2.5.1 - Co-channel Interference and System Capacity
Co-channel cells are the cells that use the same set of frequencies in a given coverage area.
Thermal noise can be overcome by increasing the signal-to-noise ration (SNR), but co-channel interference cannot be combated by simply
increasing the carrier power of a transmitter, because an increase in carrier transmit power increases the interference to neighboring
co-channel cells.
To reduce co-channel interference, co-channel cells must be physically separated by a minimum distance to provide sufficient isolation
dute to propagation.
