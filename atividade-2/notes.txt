The OFDM transmission scheme:
Available bandwith B [Hz] is split into N sub-carriers, also referred
as sub-channels. Instead of transmitting digital symbols sequentially
through one channel, the bit stream is split into N parallel streams.
Then bits from each stream are converted into digital symbols and 
transmitted in parallel. The parallel transmission has important 
consequences for the symbol length. [image from page 7]

- FDM and orthogonal frequencies
- The transmission model [with cyclic prefix]
- Frequency-selectivity nature and the correlation of sub-carriers attenuation
- Adaption of transmitter to the frequency-selective behavior of the channel to trasmit the data "better"
- "water-pouring" theorem -> "given a limited transmit power, more power is applied to frequency areas with a lower attenuation compared to the other frequencies"
- can't be applied directly
  - needs continuous transfer function, but OFDM systems are characterized by a sample version
  - the metric is capacity and continuous relationship between trasmitted power and received bits/sec is not a characteristic of applied communication systems, because they only have a limited set of modulation types
- Given a certain power budget Pmax , the number of sub-carriers and a relationship between the data rate, the error probability and the SNR per sub-carrier, a loading algorithm generates a power and/or modulation allocation for each subcarrier
- Maximizing the data rate for a given power budget
and a target bit error probability (called the bit rate maximization problem), or minimizing the transmit
power for a certain given rate and a target bit error probability (called the margin maximization
problem)
- How to generate the optimal allocation or at least a considerably “good” solution, and how to implement such a scheme in a real system?
- Description of 3.1 and solutions
- Problems and results of 3.2

- Use introductioin of this paper because is better and simple

Optimization Toolbox
- Functions for finding parameters that minimize or maximize objectives while sastifying constraints. 
- Linear programming (LP)
- Nonlinear programming (NLP)
- Others, lol
- fmincon - Find minimum of constrained nonlinear multivariable function
- min_{x}{f(x)} | {
	c(x) <= 0,
	ceq(x) = 0,
	A.x <= b,
	Aeq.x = beq,
	lb <= x <= ub
}
- x = fmincon(
	fun,
	x0,
	A,
	b,
	Aeq,
	beq,
	lb,
	ub,
	nonlcon = [c, ceq],
	options
)

- optional parameters: A = [], b = [], Aeq = [], beq = [], lb = -Inf, ub = Inf
- options = optimoptions(@fmincon, 'Algorithm', 'sqp')
- 'interior-point', 'sqp', ...

- 'interior-point' : hard to understand everything, just describes superficially what it does
- 'sqp': hard lol
